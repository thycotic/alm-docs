# Roles

When you add an ALM User to an ALM Role, the User gains the privileges of the Role.

Likewise, when you add an ALM Group to an ALM Role, the Group (and all of its added Users, now and in the future) gains the privileges of the Role.

## Assign Roles to Users

The bottom of the **Manage Role** page displays the **Add User** and **Add Group** buttons.

* To add an ALM User to an ALM Role, click the **Add User** button.
  * ALM displays the **Add User** panel.
  * Search for the User you intend to add to the Role.
  * When you have located the User, check the toggle box to select the User, and click **Add**.

## Assign Roles to Groups

* To add an ALM Group to an ALM Role, click the **Add Group** button.
  * ALM displays the **Add Group** panel.
  * Search for the Group you intend to add to the Role.
  * When you have located the Group, check the toggle box to select the Group, and click **Add**.

**note**: ALM automatically enables newly created Roles.

## Enabling/Disabling Roles

To enable or disable a Role:

* Go to **Roles \> [Select Role] \> Manage Role**.
* Use **Edit** to adjust the name of the Role.
* Use **Enable** or **Disable** to recommission or decommission a Role, respectively.

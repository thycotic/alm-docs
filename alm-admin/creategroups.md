# Groups

**Groups** confer to their User members the set of privileges defined for the Group, not to the exclusion of other privileges Users may have due to membership in other Groups or by direct assignment. Accordingly, if two Users belong to a Group, they will have in common the privileges of that Group, but will not necessarily have the same privileges as each other, overall.

* ALM Groups do **not** correspond to Active Directory Groups.
  *They are ALM objects used to control ALM User privileges, entirely within ALM.

## Creating a Group

* Type a name for the Group.
* Add Users to the Group.
  * You can return later to add more Users or remove Users.

  * You can return later to add more Roles or remove Roles.

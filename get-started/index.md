# Get Started

## ALM Initial Setup Task List

Getting started with ALM requires these tasks:

* Provisioning
* Verify requirements readiness
* Set up an ALM Engine
* Integrate with Active Directory and/or Azure Active Directory
* Integrate with Secret Server
* Integrate with DevOps Secrets Vault

## Best Practices for Using Highly Privileged Roles

When using accounts with elevated privileges, inside ALM or on your network, be cautious and deliberative about each task you perform.

Keeping in mind that with the power to do anything you could accidentally damage everything, use highly privileged accounts only for tasks that require the privileges. When you complete the tasks, log out of the privileged accounts.

Nobody should routinely log in with elevated privileges ‘just in case’ they need to perform administrative tasks.

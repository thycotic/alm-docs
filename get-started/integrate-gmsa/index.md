# Integrate Group Managed Service Accounts

## Overview:

Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSAs) provide automatic password and simplified service principal name (SPN) management to multiple servers. 

ALM supports the provisioning and lifecycle management of gMSAs. This is achieved when **Group Managed Service Account** is selected as the **Account Type** when the System Administrator is creating a **Workflow Template**.

## Requirements:
* RSAT needs to be installed on the engine machine
    * Use Powershell and run script: Install-WindowsFeature RSAT-AD-PowerShell
    * Use GUI and Enable RSAT through Turn Windows Features on or off
* Microsoft Active Directory prerequisites and one-time preparation, [see Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/group-managed-service-accounts/group-managed-service-accounts-overview)

## Parameters:
Certain Parameters are set by default and others by the attributes list in a workflow template.
* **PrincipalsAllowedToDelegateToAccount** - Set by the Users and Groups selected in the template.
* **KerberosEncryptionType** - Accepted values (None, DES, RC4, AES128, AES256). Only one is allowed.
* **ServicePrincipalNames** - Accepts a comma-separated list of service principal names. This has to be unique for each request.
